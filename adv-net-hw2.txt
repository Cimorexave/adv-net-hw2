Time needed to find the ip address = rtt1 + rtt2 + rtt3 + ... + rttn
then when the ip address is found there is the time needed to create the tcp connection = rtt0
and the time needed to request and receive the response = rtt0
so the final amount of time is: 
rtt1 + rtt2 + rtt3 + ... + rttn + 2*rtt0

yeah, you can kind of do this. if you use the "dig" command it will return the amount of time required 
to the query in the dns server. if the website has been accessed recently it will be cached in the 
dns server and therefore your query time will be 0.
